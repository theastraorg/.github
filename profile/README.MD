## Hey! Welcome to Astra 👋

We're building an ecosystem to empower indie-builders and student developers through hackathons.

Our mission is to equip the upcoming generation of creatives and builders by creating a vibrant community for sharing ideas, imparting practical skills, and exploring the potential of emerging technologies through hackathons.

This GitHub is home to all the software products developed by the Spark team for the community.
